        Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. 
        Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this 
        Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), 
        or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application 
        Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App 
        under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license 
        to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by 
        the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to 
        this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” 
        The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all 
        rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under 
        this Standard EULA.

        a. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use 
        the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or 
        control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard 
        EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or 
        purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided 
        by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, 
        unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in 
        the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application 
        available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the 
        same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed 
        Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must 
        remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You 
        may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), 
        reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, 
        or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any 
        part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing 
        restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be 
        permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components 
        included with the Licensed Application).
